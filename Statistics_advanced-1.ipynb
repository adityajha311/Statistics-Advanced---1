    "### Q1. Explain the concept of correlation in statistics. How is it measured?\n",
    "**Answer:** Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It is measured using the correlation coefficient (r), which ranges from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive), with 0 meaning no linear correlation."

    "### Q2. What is the difference between positive and negative correlation?\n",
    "**Answer:** - Positive correlation: As one variable increases, the other also increases (e.g., height vs. weight).\n",
    "- Negative correlation: As one variable increases, the other decreases (e.g., speed vs. travel time)."

    "**Answer:** Covariance measures how two variables vary together.\n",

    "**Answer:** A scatter plot visually displays the relationship between two variables. It helps identify trends, patterns, and possible correlations between variables."

    "\n",
    "r = Cov(X,Y) / (σ_X * σ_Y) \n",

    "- May be affected by data range restrictions."
